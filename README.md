# Algorithm Implementation with Python

Here we have two notebook files that implement algorithms that we encounter at every day life. Some of the questions are available at HackerRank.com site.

We solved a number of excercises and each excercise may depend on python pacheges. We recommend to see the dependences in each excercise slutions. 

Eg. 1. The solution of "n-th rare element excercise" dependes on the "collections" pachage
    2. The soution of "Email address checker" dependes on the pachage "re"
    3. and so on
